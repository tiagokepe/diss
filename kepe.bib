@book{White:2009,
	Abstract = {{Hadoop: The Definitive Guide helps you harness the power of your data. Ideal
for processing large datasets, the Apache Hadoop framework is an open source
implementation of the MapReduce algorithm on which Google built its empire.
This comprehensive resource demonstrates how to use Hadoop to build reliable,
scalable, distributed systems: programmers will find details for analyzing
large datasets, and administrators will learn how to set up and run Hadoop
clusters. Complete with case studies that illustrate how Hadoop solves
specific problems, this book helps you:

Use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing large datasets, and
run distributed computations over those datasets using MapReduce Become
familiar with Hadoop's data and I/O building blocks for compression, data
integrity, serialization, and persistence Discover common pitfalls and
advanced features for writing real-world MapReduce programs Design, build, and
administer a dedicated Hadoop cluster, or run Hadoop in the cloud Use Pig, a
high-level query language for large-scale data processing Take advantage of
HBase, Hadoop's database for structured and semi-structured data Learn
ZooKeeper, a toolkit of coordination primitives for building distributed
systems

If you have lots of data -- whether it's gigabytes or petabytes -- Hadoop is
the perfect solution. Hadoop: The Definitive Guide is the most thorough book
available on the subject. "Now you have the opportunity to learn about Hadoop
from a master-not only of the technology, but also of common sense and plain
talk." -- Doug Cutting, Hadoop Founder, Yahoo!}},
