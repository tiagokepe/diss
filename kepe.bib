@book{White:2009,
	Abstract = {{Hadoop: The Definitive Guide helps you harness the power of your data. Ideal
for processing large datasets, the Apache Hadoop framework is an open source
implementation of the MapReduce algorithm on which Google built its empire.
This comprehensive resource demonstrates how to use Hadoop to build reliable,
scalable, distributed systems: programmers will find details for analyzing
large datasets, and administrators will learn how to set up and run Hadoop
clusters. Complete with case studies that illustrate how Hadoop solves
specific problems, this book helps you:

Use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing large datasets, and
run distributed computations over those datasets using MapReduce Become
familiar with Hadoop's data and I/O building blocks for compression, data
integrity, serialization, and persistence Discover common pitfalls and
advanced features for writing real-world MapReduce programs Design, build, and
administer a dedicated Hadoop cluster, or run Hadoop in the cloud Use Pig, a
high-level query language for large-scale data processing Take advantage of
HBase, Hadoop's database for structured and semi-structured data Learn
ZooKeeper, a toolkit of coordination primitives for building distributed
systems

If you have lots of data -- whether it's gigabytes or petabytes -- Hadoop is
the perfect solution. Hadoop: The Definitive Guide is the most thorough book
available on the subject. "Now you have the opportunity to learn about Hadoop
from a master-not only of the technology, but also of common sense and plain
talk." -- Doug Cutting, Hadoop Founder, Yahoo!}},

	Abstract = {{Species diversity is marked by some interesting facts--such as larger areas
have more species, and diversity is particularly high near the equator. Other
factors to consider are what reduces diversity in ecologically productive
places and across what scales of space and time diversity patterns hold. This
book examines these questions and many others, the author employing both
theory and data in his search for answers. Surprisingly, many of the questions
have reasonably likely answers. By identifying these, attention can be turned
toward life's many still-unexplained diversity patterns. As evolutionary
ecologists race to understand biodiversity before it is too late, this book
will help set the agenda for diversity research into the next century and will
be useful to graduate students and researchers in ecology and evolutionary and
conservation biology.}},
